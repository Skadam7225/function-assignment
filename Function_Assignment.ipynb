        "#Function Assignment\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "- A function is a block of code that performs a task and can exist      independently.\n",
        " A method is a function that is defined inside a class and works with objects.\n",
        " Functions are called directly by their name, while methods are called using an object (e.g., object.method()).\n",
        " Methods usually take self as their first argument to access the objectâ€™s data.All methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, parameters are the variables defined inside the function definition, while arguments are the actual values you pass to the function when calling it. Parameters act like placeholders, and arguments provide the real data.\n",
        "There are different types of arguments in Python. Positional arguments are matched by their position. Keyword arguments are passed using parameter names. Default arguments provide a fallback value if no argument is given. Variable-length arguments using *args and **kwargs allow passing multiple values.\n",
        "In short, parameters belong to the function definition, and arguments belong to the function call.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, functions are mainly defined using the def keyword, where you specify the function name, parameters, and body. They can also be created as anonymous functions using lambda. While defining, you can use normal parameters, default parameters,( *args for variable positional arguments, and **kwargs)for variable keyword arguments.\n",
        "Functions can be called in different ways. They can be called with positional arguments by passing values in order, with keyword arguments by specifying parameter names, with default arguments when values are not provided, and with variable-length arguments using *args and **kwargs to pass multiple values\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "- The return statement in a Python function is used to send a value back from the function to the caller. It allows the function to give an output that can be stored in a variable, used in an expression, or passed to another function.\n",
        "If no return statement is used, the function automatically returns None.\n",
        "In short, return makes a function produce a result instead of just performing an action.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "-  In Python, an iterable is any object that can be looped over, such   as lists, tuples, strings, or sets. These objects use the __iter__() method to return an iterator.\n",
        " An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It remembers its position during iteration and provides elements one at a time using the __next__() method. When no more elements are left, it raises a StopIteration exception.\n",
        " The key difference is that iterables are collections you can loop through, while iterators are the actual objects that perform the iteration by keeping track of where you are.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "- In Python, generators are special functions that allow you to create iterators in a simple and memory-efficient way. Instead of returning all values at once, a generator produces values one at a time when needed.A generator is defined like a normal function, but it uses the yield statement instead of return. Each time the generator function is called, execution pauses at yield and resumes from there on the next call.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "-  Generators in Python are more memory efficient than regular functions because they produce values one at a time instead of storing the entire sequence in memory. They use lazy evaluation, meaning values are generated only when needed, which makes them suitable for large datasets or even infinite sequences. Generators also improve performance since values are yielded on demand, and they help write cleaner code by avoiding the need to manually implement iteration methods. In short, they are ideal for handling data streams efficiently\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "- A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword instead of def. It can take any number of arguments but contains only a single expression, and the result of that expression is automatically returned.\n",
        "It is typically used when you need a short, throwaway function without formally defining it using def. Common use cases include situations where functions are required temporarily, such as in map(), filter(), reduce(), or for sorting with custom keys\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "- The map() function in Python is used to apply a function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) and return a new iterator with the results. Its purpose is to simplify the process of transforming data without writing explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general syntax is:\n",
        "\n",
        "map(function, iterable)\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "- map() applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns a new iterator with the transformed results. For example, doubling each number in a list can be done with map(lambda x: x*2, numbers).\n",
        "filter() applies a function that returns True or False to each element and keeps only those elements for which the function returns True. For example, keeping only even numbers can be done with filter(lambda x: x%2==0, numbers).\n",
        "reduce() applies a function cumulatively to the elements of an iterable, reducing it to a single value. For example, finding the sum of a list can be done with reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, numbers).\n",
        "In short, map() transforms, filter() selects, and reduce() aggregates.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n",
        "list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
        "- rom functools import reduce\n",
        "reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [47, 11, 42, 13])\n",
        "Internal mechanism (step by step like pen & paper):\n",
        "First step: take the first two elements\n",
        "\n",
        "47 + 11 = 58\n",
        "Second step: take the result (58) and the next element (42)\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "113\n",
        "So, reduce() works by taking two elements at a time, applying the function, and carrying the result forward until only one value remains.\n",
